# N.O.W. Mozilla Club
The official website of Network for the Open Web - A Mozilla Campus Club at NMIMS MPSTME.

N.O.W. was founded in 2018 with one purpose - well *technically*, three interwoven principles:
- Learn
- Build
- Protect

To that extent, the club has Executives that are responsible with each of one these roles, along with a Club Captain to lead the way. We also have members belonging to cells suited to their skills.
We have conducted a few events, and have laid the groundwork for some more in the coming months.

We're committed to everything Open Source and all things Secure!

Check out the [website](http://nowmozilla.club) and stay tuned for more updates!
